Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
========================================

There are two files in this folder:
1.  Har.r - This is an r script that downloads the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The script will check to see if the data exists in the home folder, and if not, dowload it for you.
This script requires the r package "reshape2" and will likewise install this package if not present already.
This script was written and tested on a Windows 8 computer using r version 3.1.0.  It may not work on Mac or Linux.

2.  The Code book.   - This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
